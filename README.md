Windows service for monitoring registry changes,process and drive mounting detection. 

# How Does It Work ?
A windows service is an application which runs in the background. In this project, a windows service will be built to monitor key events: registry changes, process monitoring, and drive mounting detection.This can eventually become a program to provide alerts for malicious activity.

# Goal for Current Version 
The first version of the service aims to detect near run-time changes in windows registry for different processes
